##Dokku notes

Changes done to make it deploy with dokku

 - Add DATABASE_URL in the production group of config/database.yml
 
 - Add the ruby version used/required in the gemfile, otherwise dokku picks the wrong version.
 
       ###### WARNING:
       You have not declared a Ruby version in your Gemfile.
       To set your Ruby version add this line to your Gemfile:
       ruby '2.4.1'

 - Run a db:migrate by hand on the server:
   dokku run myapp bin/rake db:migrate
